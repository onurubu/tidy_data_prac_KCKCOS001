# Coşkun Onur Küçükkaragöz (KCKCOS001) - Tidy data assignment

All data used come from the example dataset provided by Jasper Slingsby for this assignment.
Metadata for the dataset can be found in the fourth sheet of the "transplants_29May2012.xls" workbook.

The main folder for the repository contains the R project file and there are three subfolders: "data", "code", and "outputs". The data folder has two subfolders, "raw" and "tidy". The raw folder contains "transplants_29May2012.xls" which is the rawdata file that all of the code is based upon. The tidy data folder contains "transplants_29may2012_tidy.csv" which is the "tidy" version of the raw data in long format.

The code folder contains the R script for this assignment.

The outputs folder contains a number of generated datasets. Some of them are filtered sets that only contain data from specific criteria, while others are summary data sets that contain various summary information about the data set that I thought could be useful. There is also a summary plot in the folde showing the difference between the measured quantities and the different sites assessed in the data.

Basic Instructions: Launch the project file from the main folder and then launch the R script in the "code" subfolde from within R. All of the directories have been written so that the code will work without any editing or setup required.

All the comments explain what is being done on each line of code. Certain lines have additional instructions that will allow you to generate filtered tables of your own and save them to the outputs subfolder. All naming of user generaed tables and outputs will be done automatically depending on the parameters chosen.
